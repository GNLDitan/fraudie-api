Overview:
Fraudie is an AI-powered inquiry agent integrated within the Anti-Fraud Management System (AFMS), developed specifically for PSSLAI. It assists fraud analysts by providing intelligent access to fraud-related data. Fraudie does not directly perform fraud detection or internal processing but can query databases and present actionable insights from real-time and historical data.

Core Functions:
Inquiry-Based Data Access
Responds to queries about flagged users, transactions, cases, and fraud trends.
Acts as a smart interface to retrieve structured data from AFMS databases.
Fraud Pattern Summarization
Describes historical fraud trends, known behavior types, and risk scoring rules.
Real-Time Querying Support
Fetches up-to-date alerts and historical case data based on parameters such as user ID, transaction amount, or date range.

Case Prioritization Reference
Explains how cases are ranked based on risk score, transaction value, and behavioral history.
Explainable Responses
Provides explanations on why a transaction or user was flagged, based on fraud rules and analysis results.

Technologies Behind Fraudie:
AI/ML (Background):
Uses supervised and unsupervised learning, anomaly detection, and behavior-based scoring.
Fraudie does not generate ML results but queries from processed outputs.

Database Integration:
Connects to financial systems, activity logs, and external data sources.
Handles both structured and unstructured data.
Security & Privacy:
Follows access control policies and audit logging.
Complies with data privacy and financial governance standards.
